        My friends you all are invited to join my Birthday party.
        Before that we all will take a vote for the location.
        When you are successfully done the vote I will decide the Birthaday party location.
        Just follow the option and vote for the location.
        Most voted place will be the Birthday location.See you all in the party. Thanks.</p>
